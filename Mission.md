*Here is a proposal for the mission statement of a revived Code for Europe. Please feel free to adapt, suggest improvements or additions.*

#Code For Europe
Code for Europe is a network of software developers that collaboratively develop digital services for cities and communities. 
We do this in order to solve real, human problems in a reusable, flexible, inclusive way. 
We empower local communities to build, share and adapt civic tech to solve local challenges while profiting from the shared experience of an international network of likeminded fellows.

#Principles
### Civic tech should be owned by the community
We beleive civic tech should be owned by the people, open source and transparent.

### Prototype, prototype, prototype
Fast, iterative development and testing.

### We'd rather have Empathic than Smart cities
It's not about the technology, it's about the people.
